# Dope Sheet (v16)

The editor includes a lightweight dope sheet:
- Lists all tracks/channels and key counts
- Allows selecting a channel for graph editing
- Includes a coarse "global key shift" tool (retiming)

This is intended as a usability layer for artists, while keeping the editor dependency-free.
