# Trajectory handles (v15)

The Camera Path Visualizer can display:
- Keyframe markers (derived from camera transform keyframes)
- Trajectory handles (approximate direction vectors from the sampled path)

This is intentionally lightweight: it gives artists immediate feedback about motion continuity without needing a full 3D editor.
