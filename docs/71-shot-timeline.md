# Shot Timeline (v18)

Adds a shot/cut timeline panel:
- View and select shots as blocks over the frame range
- Add shots, delete selected
- Split selected shot at a frame (press Enter)
- Edit shot start/end and transition-in/out lengths

Transitions are stored as metadata for later pipeline blending (prompt/seed/camera crossfades).
