# A1111 Extension Stub (Staged)

This folder is a placeholder for the next milestone:
- Add an A1111 extension that loads `.defx`
- Evaluates camera/timeline per frame via `deforum_core`
- Feeds evaluated parameters into A1111 image generation / Deforum pipeline

Kept intentionally minimal to avoid coupling this MVP to any specific WebUI commit.
